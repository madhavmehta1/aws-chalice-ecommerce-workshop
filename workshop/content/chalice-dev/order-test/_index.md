## Test the app
Push your code changes to your repository. After the application has deployed, if you are not already signed in to the website, please sign in with the user you checked out with when testing the `/checkout` endpoint.

Click on the user nav bar in the top right corner of the webpage and select `My Orders`. If your endpoint is working correctly, you will see your order on this page. It will look similar to this:
{{< img "order-history-test.png" "Order History Test">}}

You can further test the endpoint by adding more items to your cart and checking out a few times. The webpage should display all your orders.
